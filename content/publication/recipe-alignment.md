abstract = "Automatically generating textual video narrations that are time-aligned with the video content is a long-standing goal in computer vision. It is challenging due to the difficulty of bridging the semantic gap between the visual and natural language domains. This paper addresses the task of automatically generating an alignment between a recipe and a first person video demonstrating how to prepare the dish. The sparse descriptions and ambiguity of written instructions create significant alignment challenges. The key to our approach is the use of egocentric cues to generate a concise set of action proposals, which are then matched to recipe steps using object detections and computational lingustic techniques. We obtain promising results on an new version of the GTEA Gaze+ dataset."
