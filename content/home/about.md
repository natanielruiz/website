# Biography

Nataniel Ruiz is a MSc student at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests within Computer Vision are Facial Analysis, First Person Vision, Behavioral Imaging and Object Detection. He is also interested in Learning Representation and more broadly in Machine Learning theory and applications. He is currently working since 2016 as a research assistant for Director of the Georgia Tech's Center for Behavioral Imaging and co-Director of the Computational Perception Lab - [Dr. James Rehg](http://rehg.org/). He has also worked at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory under [Dr. Lalana Kagal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lkagal/) and [Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni](http://www.kalyanv.org/) as a visiting research assistant.

During his years at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) and [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/) he has developed two open source computer vision applications: [Dockerface](https://github.com/natanielruiz/dockerface) and [android-yolo](https://github.com/natanielruiz/android-yolo). He has taken rigorous research-oriented courses on Computer Vision (under [Dr. James Hays](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/)) and Machine Learning (under Dr. Le Song). He has also co-authored two papers in 2017: **Fine-Grained Head Pose Estimation Without Keypoints** currently under review for [IEEE FG 2018](https://fg2018.cse.sc.edu/) and **Learning to Localize and Align Fine-Grained Actions to Sparse Instructions** soon to be published on arxiv.org. During that same year he contributed to one paper published at [ACM IMWUT 2017](http://imwut.acm.org/) and presented at [Ubicomp 2017](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2017/) titled **Detecting Gaze Towards Eyes in Natural Social Interactions and Its Use in Child Assessment**.

Finally during his stay at Ecole Polytechnique he obtained the Outstanding Leadership award for the founding of the first [TEDxEcolePolytechnique](https://www.tedxecolepolytechnique.com/) conference. Additionally he worked as Speaker & Startup Relations Manager at Polytechnique's Entrepreneurship Society and helped organize one of Europe's largest [Startup Weekends](http://polytechniqueparis.startupweekend.org/) and the first [Startup Career Fair](https://workshop.cabinetstartup.fr/).
