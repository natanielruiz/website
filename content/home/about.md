# Biography

Nataniel Ruiz is a MSc student at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests within Computer Vision are First Person Vision, Behavioral Imaging, Object Detection and Facial Analysis. He is also interested in Learning Representation and more broadly in Machine Learning theory and applications. He is currently working since 2016 as a research assistant for Director of the Georgia Tech's Center for Behavioral Imaging and co-Director of the Computational Perception Lab - Dr. James Rehg. He has also worked at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory under Dr. Lalana Kagal and Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni as a visiting research assistant.

During his years at Ecole Polytechnique and Georgia Tech he has developed several open source machine learning applications and has taken rigorous research-oriented courses on Computer Vision (under Dr. James Hays) and Machine Learning (under Dr. Le Song). He has also co-authored two papers in 2017, one of which will be published at the prestigious Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT) journal and presented at the Ubicomp 2017 conference. Finally during his stay at Ecole Polytechnique he obtained the Outstanding Leadership award for the founding of the first TEDxEcolePolytechnique conference and the organization of one of Europe's largest Startup Weekends and the first Startup Career Fair as a part of the school's Startup student club.
