# Biography

Nataniel Ruiz is a MSc student at Georgia Institute of Technology. His research interests within Computer Vision are Facial Analysis, First Person Vision, Behavioral Imaging and Object Detection. More broadly he is interested in Machine Learning theory and applications. He is currently working since 2016 as a research assistant for Director of Georgia Tech's Center for Behavioral Imaging and co-Director of the Computational Perception Lab - [Dr. James Rehg](http://rehg.org/).

He has also worked at MIT CSAIL under [Dr. Lalana Kagal](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lkagal/) and [Dr. Kalyan Veeramachaneni](http://www.kalyanv.org/) as a visiting research assistant where he built a deep learning Android application for visual detection of diseases in cassava plant leaves and deployed the application in Kampala, Uganda alongside collaborators from Makerere University while being funded by a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant.

During 2017 at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/), while taking a full-time course load, he has developed three popular open source computer vision applications: [deep-head-pose](https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose), [Dockerface](https://github.com/natanielruiz/dockerface) and [android-yolo](https://github.com/natanielruiz/android-yolo), co-authored one technical report and three papers:

-[**Fine-Grained Head Pose Estimation Without Keypoints**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00925) currently under review for [IEEE FG 2018](https://fg2018.cse.sc.edu/).

-[**Learning to Localize and Align Fine-Grained Actions to Sparse Instructions**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2fFW2t9-qW3NVBDNGRBbFJ0aEU) soon to be published on arxiv.org.

-[**Detecting Gaze Towards Eyes in Natural Social Interactions and Its Use in Child Assessment**](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3131902) published at [ACM IMWUT 2017](http://imwut.acm.org/) and presented at [Ubicomp 2017](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2017/).

Finally during his stay at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), France's NÂ°1 ranked Grande Ecole in Science and Engineering, he obtained the Outstanding Leadership award for the founding of the first [TEDxEcolePolytechnique](https://www.tedxecolepolytechnique.com/) conference. Additionally he worked as Speaker & Startup Relations Manager at Polytechnique's [Entrepreneurship Society](https://www.cabinetstartup.fr/) and helped organize one of Europe's largest Startup Weekends and the first Startup Career Fair.
